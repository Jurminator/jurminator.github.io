title: Slime mold racetrack - Building a (big) Incubator
---

Our goal is to create a slime mold racetrack, allowing different slime mold cultures to compete against each other on a race track and meet the finish line or capture the flag. Possibly we will broadcast the races and allow designs of racetracks to be sent to us by the community.

We built a first fast prototype of the incubator to get our juices flowing. This has become a wide one to allow for enough area to put a race track on. We wanted to see if heating would be sufficient and what kind of other challenges we would encounter.
